3D-Filaments
=====

3D-Filaments is a code for painting filaments in the Celestial Sphere, to generate a full sky map of the Thermal Dust emission at millimeter frequencies by integrating a population of 3D filaments.

Available maps
--------------

Our maps are located at ...
The units of our maps are uK Thermo units.
We create full sky maps of T,Q,U emission at 20, 27, 39, 93, 145, 225, 280 GHz. Also we include maps at 217 and 353 GHz. We include maps with Q,U large scale filled by the Planck template, as well as the calibrated map without this large-scale filled and before filtering by a high-pass filter. This is the raw Q,U map directly from our code, but calibrated to uK thermo units.
